Design exactly ${count} high-impact, study-oriented multiple-choice questions for:
- Grade Level: ${gradeLevel} (${pedagogy.tierName}, Learner Age: ${pedagogy.ageTarget})
- Subject: ${subject}

MANDATORY STUDY-COACH ARCHETYPES (CRITICAL ANTI-MONOTONY RULE):
To ensure questions act as an interactive STUDY GUIDE rather than repetitive pop-quiz drills, you MUST distribute the ${count} questions across these distinct learning archetypes:

1. ARCHETYPE 1 — CONCEPT & RULE DIAGNOSTIC:
   Tests the underlying definition, "why it works", or foundational principle before calculating (e.g. "What does the denominator represent in a fraction?", "Why must we find a common denominator before adding?").

2. ARCHETYPE 2 — VISUAL, SPATIAL, OR MODEL REASONING:
   Asks the student to interpret or identify a mental or visual model (e.g. number line intervals, area grids, coordinate positions, diagram, or chart representation).

3. ARCHETYPE 3 — EVERYDAY REAL-WORLD WORD PROBLEM:
   A rich multi-step scenario with relatable student names (Aarav, Priya, Maya, Lucas, Elena), realistic quantities, and a clear story context (e.g. baking, building, sports stats).

4. ARCHETYPE 4 — "SPOT THE MISTAKE" (ERROR ANALYSIS & TRAP DIAGNOSIS):
   Presents a fictional student's flawed attempt (e.g. "Aarav tried to solve X and got Y. Which step contains his error?") and asks the student to diagnose the mistake.

5. ARCHETYPE 5 — REVERSE & MULTI-STEP SYNTHESIS CHALLENGE:
   A non-routine challenge requiring two-step reasoning or working backwards from a known outcome to find an unknown value.

CRITICAL ANTI-REPETITION CONSTRAINTS:
- NEVER generate two bare calculation drills (e.g. "What is 12 × 4?" and "What is 15 × 3?"). That is strictly forbidden!
- NEVER repeat question stems (e.g. avoid starting multiple questions with "What is...").
- Distribute questions across the 5 archetypes so each question teaches a distinct dimension of "${topic}".

Difficulty Distribution:
- ~30% Easy (foundational recall and direct concept recognition)
- ~40% Medium (application, two-step reasoning)
- ~30% Hard (multi-step synthesis, non-routine critical thinking)

For each question, provide:
1. Clear, engaging, and grade-appropriate question text specifically about "${topic}" in ${subject}
2. Exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D) with exactly one definitively correct answer and 3 realistic distractors reflecting common student misconceptions
3. The letter of the correct answer: MUST be generously and evenly distributed across A, B, C, and D across the set (~25% each). DO NOT bias toward B or any single letter!
4. A "STUDY COACH" KID-FRIENDLY EXPLANATION:
   - Written directly to a ${pedagogy.tierName} student in clear, friendly language.
   - Concise 2-3 sentence format: "Step 1: [Core concept]. Step 2: [Why the correct answer works]. 💡 Tip: [Quick memory hint]."
5. Difficulty level ("easy", "medium", or "hard")
6. A confidence score from 92-100
